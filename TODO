1. makeMove, use meaningful constant values instead of hardcoding numbers
2. move all constants to separate file (i.e KING instead of SQ.K)
3. complete convertMoveToNotation() function
4. fix perft() function. debug using moveNotations above ^^
5. create engine.tests for king castling (king can_castle flag, then can castle. king castling through attacked squares, cannot castle)
6. don't use has_moved flag king or rook. use can_castle only!
7. create engine.tests for enpassant moves
8. validate move -> check whether king squares are attacked during castle
9. EDGE validation for engine.tests
