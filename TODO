4. fix perft() function. PAWN IS MOVING DIAGONAL WHEN CAPTURE IS UNAVAILABLE !!
1. makeMove, use meaningful constant values instead of hardcoding numbers
5. create engine.tests for king castling (king can_castle flag, then can castle. king castling through attacked squares, cannot castle)
7. create engine.tests for enpassant moves
8. validate move -> check whether king squares are attacked during castle
9. EDGE validation for engine.tests
6. don't use has_moved flag king or rook. use can_castle only!
